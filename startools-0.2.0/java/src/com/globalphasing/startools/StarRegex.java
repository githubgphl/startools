		"^;([\\S\\s]*?)(?:\\r\\n|\\s)^;(?:(?=\\s)|$)  # Multi-line string\n"
		                            /*-  Multi-line text string.
										N.B. (i) the closing semicolon must be followed by whitespace
										or end of input, otherwise we have a syntax error
										Minimal match on [\\S\\s]*?, so that the group ends on the next
										newline-semicolon. If this newline-semicolon is not followed
										by whitespace or end of input, the group does not match, leading
										to an eventual BAD_TOKEN
										N.B. (ii) the final newline is not part of the data. The non-
										capturing group (?:\\r\\n|\\s) ensures that it is not included in the
										returned token (allowing for the two-character DOS line ending).
										N.B. (iii) Python compatibility considerations prevent us using
										(?s)/(?-s)/(?s:...): Python regex's only allow the use of this flag
										for the whole pattern, not parts of it. [\\S\\s] lets us match any character
										including line terminators, without having to enable the DOTALL option.
										Using [..] rather than ..|.. speeds up tokenising by a factor of
										about 6.
