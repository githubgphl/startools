# StarTools

A regular expression-based tokeniser for STAR/CIF/mmCIF data.

This repository currently contains the contents of the downloadable TAR file from 
the original StarTools site http://www.globalphasing.com/startools/ . It will be
rearranged into a more appropriate form for GitHub soon.

Please also refer to the original site http://www.globalphasing.com/startools/
for the article providing the background. This article will soon be updated
and moved here as well.
